Some useful codes for teaching spectroscopic stellar parameters


To make the interpolation of the codes you need the grid of MARCS models with can be downloaded and extracted by:

wget www.astro.up.pt/~sousasag/xpto123/marcs_models.tar
mv marcs_models.tar interpol_models_marcs
cd interpol_models_marcs
tar xvf marcs_models.tar


Other codes to install:

IRAF (http://iraf.noao.edu/)

There are several ways to install IRAF on your system.
One that It was been easy recently and that I recomend is with Ureka (http://ssb.stsci.edu/ureka/)
