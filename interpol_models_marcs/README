The c++ codes uses the models downloaded from http://marcs.astro.uu.se/

The grid of model is not complete. The c++ codes trys to find replacement models for the interpolation where the close model does not exists.

Before compiling the codes check paths:

interpol_marcs_moog.cpp:
	line 55 for model path. 
	line 291 for template script
interpol_template.com
	line 29 PATH for models folders 
	line 59 PATH for the location of the interpolation code


The fortran interpolation code was modified to change the format of output file 2 (for MOOG)

Compilation of the codes:
#use g95 or ifort for fortran code:
g95 -o interpol_modeles interpol_modeles_mine.f

#use g++ for c++ code:
g++ -o interpol_marcs interpol_marcs_moog.cpp

OUTPUT to be used on MOOG: out_marcs.atm


NOTE: it is required the csh or tcsh installed in the system
